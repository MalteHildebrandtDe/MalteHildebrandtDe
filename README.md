# Hi, my name is Malte Hildebrandt :)

Atmospheric science student based in Innsbruck, Austria, with a strong interest in data-driven research, interdisciplinary projects, and the practical application of scientific knowledge.

## About

I am currently completing a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Innsbruck in cooperation with the Geosphere Austria (Sonnblick). In parallel, I am enrolled in a Bachelor's program in Educational Science as a complementary field, focusing on science communication, didactics, and knowledge transfer.

My academic and personal work revolves around understanding complex environmental systems, working with data, and making scientific results more transparent and accessible. I am particularly interested in the interface between atmospheric science, operational workflows, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## What I work on

My projects span a mix of academic work, research-related experiments, and smaller exploratory ideas. This repository space is used to collect, document, and gradually structure this work.

A significant part of my previous project work was conducted within university environments using internal GitLab instances. As a result, some older repositories are no longer actively maintained or publicly available. I am currently in the process of selectively migrating, cleaning up, and documenting projects here on GitHub.

You will find:
- Research-related code and analyses connected to atmospheric and climate data  
- Material related to my Master's thesis and academic coursework  
- Smaller exploratory projects and experiments  
- Documentation and notes from interdisciplinary and collaborative projects

## Selected interests & projects

- **Global weather forecasting, extreme events, and multiple hazards:**  
  Core interest in large-scale and regional weather forecasting, with a focus on extreme weather, compound and cascading hazards, and the use of atmospheric information to support decision-making and risk reduction for affected communities.

- **Atmosphere–space system, space weather & analog missions:**  
  Interest in atmosphere–space interactions and space weather as part of a coupled system, combined with involvement in analog mission environments such as *World’s Biggest Analog (WBA)*. These contexts serve as testbeds for operational workflows, forecasting under uncertainty, interdisciplinary collaboration, and structured documentation in simulated mission settings.

- **Accessible weather communication and warnings:**  
  Strong interest in making weather information, forecasts, and warnings understandable and usable for as many people as possible. This includes clear structuring of information, awareness of uncertainty, and communication across different audiences, regions, and levels of technical background.

## Notes

This GitHub profile is an evolving workspace rather than a polished portfolio. Some repositories are experimental, incomplete, or exploratory by design. Over time, I aim to better structure and curate this space as projects mature.
